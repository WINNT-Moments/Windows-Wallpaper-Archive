# Windows-Wallpaper-Archive
A repository dedicated entirely to Microsoft Windows wallpapers. All wallpapers are directly sourced from real Windows hard drives / images; None of these files are modified.

There are a LOT of wallpapers in this repository. If you want, you can recommend a version of Windows to rip wallpapers from, and I'll try to upload whatever wallpapers I can find!

If one of the files said it was modified in recent times, it's probably because I used the file, or because it was on a newer installation.

Edit: Added more Longhorn wallpapers!

Not sure what to add next. I'll try some type of exotic Windows 8, or 7 build, probably.
